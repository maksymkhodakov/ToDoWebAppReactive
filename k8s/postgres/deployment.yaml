# DEPRECATED — replaced by statefulset.yaml
#
# A StatefulSet is used instead of a Deployment for postgres because:
#   - It provides stable, unique pod DNS names (postgres-0.postgres-headless)
#   - It manages its own PVC lifecycle via volumeClaimTemplates
#   - It guarantees ordered, graceful pod termination
#
# Apply statefulset.yaml + headless-service.yaml instead of this file.
# The postgres-pvc.yaml is also no longer needed; the StatefulSet creates
# PVCs automatically from its volumeClaimTemplates.
